An open-source random password generator. Runs on .Net, if you inspect the source and trust it feel free to use it, if not, not. Really danged simple.

Written as an old-school Windows Forms app to maximize compatibility with other .Net platforms like Mono.

The random generation portion is in MainForm.cs in the button1_Click method.
